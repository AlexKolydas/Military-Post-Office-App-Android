I developed this native Android application in order to streamline the workflow while delivering mail within the Greek Armed Forces's headquarters. Previously a paper-based system was used in order to decide the appropriate route in order to deliver the mail, however using this application allowed us to be more efficient, decide the final routing faster and in a more automated and error-free way. 

Due to operational security concerns, this application provides features like automatic user session termination and automatic rolling of user account credentials.
